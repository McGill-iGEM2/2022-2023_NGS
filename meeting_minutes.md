Problems:
- IndelRealigner not available in GATK > v3.6 -> look into alternatives (@olivialopardo)
- Calling Mutect2 on BAM files -> get GATK working then call Mutect2 (@bsegall02 @jennifertramsu)
- How to count # of reeds to get mutation frequency -> either manually or with a tool (@henry @olivialopardo)
    - Does Mutect2 already do this or do we need another tool?
